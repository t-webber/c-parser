///
/// When pushing an `else` keyword into an

/// the latter is pushable iff the control flow is complete (not

/// control flow, the latter is not pushable iff the control flow is full (not
/// only complete). See
/// [`is_full`](crate::parser::keyword::control_flow::traits::ControlFlow::is_full)
/// and [`is_complete`](crate::parser::keyword::control_flow::traits::ControlFlow::is_complete)
/// to see the difference.
